# Gold_Badge_Challenges
First Challenge (Cafe)
Creating classes and repo was pretty straightforward after giving the methods some thought and research(if I did it correctly)
The logic of implementing program UI was definitely biggest struggle for all projects
General Description of the project - The console prompts a manager at a cafe to either list the items on a menu, add a menu item, or take off a menu item. Based on the response, the console will then take the manager through questions to complete whichever task the manager is wishing to complete.

Second Challenge(Claim)
Creating class and repo required a little more attention as they included lists. Did have to do research on how to manipulate methods in repo containing lists to communicate with programUI.
After working out some of the methods, I did some research and it seemed like the better type to implement would be a Queue<Claims> so I switched out my List for Queue.
The logic was still biggest struggle(probably always will be). Goes back to figuring out how to manipulate types and variables to be what you want to show the user. 
Formatting was also a struggle (when printing to the console). After doing research and watching videos, I could not find any way to change the format of the console when listing out claims, other than spacing out items in Console.WriteLine. This caused problems in other areas of the project but it was the best solution I could come up with given the time. 
General Description - The console prompts a claims agent (insurance) to either add a claim, print the list of claims, or deal with next claim. Based on the response, the console will take the agent through questions to complete whichever task the agent wants to complete.

Third Challenge(Badges)
Creating class and repo was a little different this time. I may be incorrect but I did not provide any classes, only an instance of a dictionary with the key of badge Id's and the value of door name/number. 
After diving into how to use a dictionary, I realized my values in my dicitonary would have to be a List<string> instead of just a string. 
This helped me immensely as I could not get methods to return desired results from repo while using just "string".
Biggest struggle was getting the results from the repo and being able to display them in a certain way that is specific to different methods (i.e. list of badges would be listed out one way, Caliing for one badge would be listed in a different way)
General Description - The console prompts a guard or front desk employee to either add, update, delete, or list out all the badges and respective doors. The console will then take the employee through questions to complete whichever task the employee wants to complete.
